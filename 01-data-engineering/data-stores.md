# AWS Data Stores for Machine Learning

- Redshift:
    - Used for Data Warehousing, SQL analytics
    - OLAP (Online analytical processing) datastore
    - We can load data form S3 into S3 or we can use Redshift Spectrum to query data directly from S3
- RDS, Aurora:
    - These are relation, OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) datastores
    - We have to provision servers in advance (excluding Aurora serverless)
- DynamoDB:
    - It is a serverless NoSQL datastore
    - It can be used in provisioned mode (we have to provision read/write capacity) or in on-demand mode
    - It is useful to store machine learning models served by other applications
- S3:
    - Used for object storage
    - It is serverless, it provides "infinite" storage
    - Integrates with most AWS services
- OpenSearch (prev. ElasticSearch):
    - Used for indexing and searching data

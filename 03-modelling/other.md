## t-SNE

- Definition (from: https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/introduction-t-sne):
    - t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) is an unsupervised non-linear dimensionality reduction technique for data exploration and visualizing high-dimensional data
    - Non-linear dimensionality reduction means that the algorithm allows us to separate data that cannot be separated by a straight line
- t-SNE vs PCA:
     - PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is a linear technique that works best with data that has a linear structure
     - t-SNE is a nonlinear technique that focuses on preserving the pairwise similarities between data points in a lower-dimensional space
